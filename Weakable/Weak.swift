/**
 This is the main point of contact with Weakable.
 The `Weak` struct holds a weak reference to an object.

 The way you create a `Weak` is:

 ```swift
 //Given a class
 class TestClass {}
 //and an instance of that class
 var aTestObject = TestClass()

 //You can create a Weak like this:
 let weakTestObject = Weak(aTestObject)
 ```

 Then you can access the underlying object by:

 ```swift
 weakTestObject.object
 ```

 The underlying object will be there just as long as some other part of your code holds a strong reference to it.
 Once it is released there, `Weak` will release it too.
