![Weakable](./Images/weakable.png)

Weakable is an easy way to hold `weak` references in Swift.

With Weakable you can create weak arrays, weak dictionaries and many other cool things.

üòé

## Requirements

* iOS 12+
* watchOS 4+
* tvOS 12+
* macOS 11+
* Swift 4+

## Usage

Declare your `Weak` variable in one of the two ways provided:

```swift
//Given a class
class TestClass {}
//and an instance of that class
var aTestObject = TestClass()

//You can create a Weak like this:
var weakTestObject = Weak(aTestObject)

//Or using the shorthand operator ‚âà
var anotherWeakTestObject = ‚âàtest
```

Access your variable:

```swift
weakTestObject.object //returns your value as an optional, since it may or may not have been released
```

## Operators

`Weakable` comes with 3 operators, all using the `‚âà` character (**‚å• + x**).

* `prefix ‚âà`
  * Shorthand contructor for a `Weak` variable:

```swift
//Given an object
let object = AwesomeClass()

//you can create a Weak by either
var weakObject = Weak(object)

//or
var weakObject = ‚âàobject
```

* `postfix operator ‚âà`
  * Shorthand accessor for `Weak`:
  
```swift
//Given a Weak
var weakObject = ‚âàobject

//you can access the underlying object by
weakObject.object

//or
weakObject‚âà
```

* `infix operator ‚âà`
  * Shorthand assignment for `Weak`:
  
```swift
//Given a Weak
var weakObject = ‚âàobject

//you can change the underlying object by
weakObject.object = anotherObject

//or
weakObject ‚âà anotherObject
```
    
## Arrays and Dictionaries

You can safely store your `Weak` variables in collections (eg. `[Weak<TestClass>]`). The underlaying objects won't be retained.

```swift
var tests = (1...10).map { TestClass() } // 10 elements
var weakTests = ‚âàtests // 10 elements

tests.removeLast() // `tests` now have 9 elements, but `weakTests` have 10

weakTests = weakTests.filterWeaks() // `weakTests` now have 9 elements too, since we dropped the released objects from it
```

You can also quickly "unwrap" the elements in a `Weak` collection:

```swift
let tests = weakTests.compactWeaks()
```

The variable `tests` will now be a `[TestClass]` containing only the elements that haven't been released yet.

## Global weaks

Version `2.0` introduces the concept of global weak variables. Say you want to share the same instance of a class in several places, but you want to release the global variable once all other references are destroyed. That's what a global weak is.

```
final class TestClass: WeaklyGloballyIdentifiable {
    typealias GlobalID = Int

    @WeakGlobalActor
    static var weakGlobals: [GlobalID: Weak<TestClass>] = [:]
}

let firstInstance = TestClass.weakGlobal(id: 1, default: TestClass())
let secondInstance = TestClass.weakGlobal(id: 1, default: TestClass())

print(firstInstance === secondInstance) // `true`
```

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/BellAppLab/Weakable", from: "2.0")
]
```

Then `import Weakable` where needed.

### Legacy

The following import methods only work for version `1.0.1`. 

#### Cocoapods

```ruby
pod 'Weakable', '~> 1.0'
```

Then `import Weakable` where needed.

#### Carthage

```swift
github "BellAppLab/Weakable" ~> 1.0
```

Then `import Weakable` where needed.

#### Git Submodules

```
cd toYourProjectsFolder
git submodule add -b submodule --name Weakable https://github.com/BellAppLab/Weakable.git
```

Then drag the `Weakable` folder into your Xcode project.
