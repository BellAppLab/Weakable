![Weakable](./Images/weakable.png)

Weakable is an easy way to hold `weak` references in Swift.

With Weakable you can create weak arrays, weak dictionaries and many other cool things.

üòé

## Requirements

* iOS 9+
* watchOS 3+
* tvOS 9+
* macOS 10.11+
* Swift 3.3+

## Usage

Declare your `Weak` variable in one of the two ways provided:

```swift
//Given a class
class TestClass {}
//and an instance of that class
var aTestObject = TestClass()

//You can create a Weak like this:
var weakTestObject = Weak(aTestObject)

//Or using the shorthand operator ‚âà
var anotherWeakTestObject = ‚âàtest
```

Access your variable:

```swift
weakTestObject.object //returns your value as an optional, since it may or may not have been released
```

## Operators

`Weakable` comes with 3 operators, all using the `‚âà` character (**‚å• + x**).

* `prefix ‚âà`
  * Shorthand contructor for a `Weak` variable:

```swift
//Given an object
let object = AwesomeClass()

//you can create a Weak by either
var weakObject = Weak(object)

//or
var weakObject = ‚âàobject
```

* `postfix operator ‚âà`
  * Shorthand accessor for `Weak`:
  
```swift
//Given a Weak
var weakObject = ‚âàobject

//you can access the underlying object by
weakObject.object

//or
weakObject‚âà
```

* `infix operator ‚âà`
  * Shorthand assignment for `Weak`:
  
```swift
//Given a Weak
var weakObject = ‚âàobject

//you can change the underlying object by
weakObject.object = anotherObject

//or
weakObject ‚âà anotherObject
```
    
## Arrays and Dictionaries

You can safely store your `Weak` variables in collections (eg. `[Weak<TestClass>]`). The underlaying objects won't be retained.

```swift
var tests = (1...10).map { TestClass() } // 10 elements
var weakTests = tests.map { ‚âà$0 } // 10 elements

tests.removeLast() // `tests` now have 9 elements, but `weakTests` have 10

weakTests = weakTests.filterWeaks() // `weakTests` now have 9 elements too, since we dropped the released objects from it
```

You can also quickly "unwrap" the elements in a `Weak` collection:

```swift
let tests = weakTests.compactWeaks()
```

The variable `tests` will now be a `[TestClass]` containing only the elements that haven't been released yet.

## Installation

### Cocoapods

```ruby
pod 'Weakable', '~> 1.0'
```

Then `import Weakable` where needed.

### Carthage

```swift
github "BellAppLab/Weakable" ~> 1.0
```

Then `import Weakable` where needed.

### Swift Package Manager

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/BellAppLab/Weakable", from: "1.0")
]
```

Then `import Weakable` where needed.

### Git Submodules

```
cd toYourProjectsFolder
git submodule add -b submodule --name Weakable https://github.com/BellAppLab/Weakable.git
```

Then drag the `Weakable` folder into your Xcode project.
